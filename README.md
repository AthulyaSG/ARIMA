# Rice Production Forecast Using ARIMA Model

## Introduction

- Forecasting the production of rice using ARIMA model
- Bivariate analysis
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/vaibhavkhande/analysis-on-crop-production-in-different-countries/notebook
- Preprocess the data
    * Removed columns not required
    * replace() and dropna() to remove null values
    * Used groupby() to calculate the mean crop yield for each country

## Plotting Rolling Statistics

- To understand trends and patterns [upward or downward trend]
- To detect changes in variance [shift in the underlying process (depending on SD changes)]
- To assess stationarity [statistical properties do not change over time]
- To improve forecasting accuracy [smooth out the data]

## Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

- To check whether the time series is stationary or not

## Coupling AD-Fuller check with MA and moving SD

- To identify the trend and volatility of the data

## Data Transformation

### Logarithmic Transformation

- To stabilize the variance of the data
- To convert multiplicative relationships into additive relationships
- To make the data more normally distributed

### Removing Trend With Moving Average

- To identify seasonal patterns
- To stabilize the variance of the data
- To make the time series stationary

### Exponential Decay Transformation

- To stabilize the variance of the data
- To model and analyze the data using traditional time series techniques

### Time Shift Transformation

- To compare and analyze data at different lags
- To identify the time delay between the two variables
- To better understand the relationship between them

## Decompose

- To separate a time series into trend, seasonality, and residual (or noise)

## Auto Correlation Function and Partial Auto Correlation

- ACF: the correlation of the time series with its past values over different lags
- PACF: the correlation of the time series with its past values over different lags, but without the influence of other lags

## Auto Regression (AR) Model

- Uses past values of a variable to predict its future values
- Parameters
 	* p, the number of lagged values (order of autoregression)
	* q, the number of past errors q (order of moving average)
	* d, the number of times the time series is differenced to make it stationary (order of differencing)

## Moving Average Model

- Used to identify trends and patterns in data
- Used to make predictions about future trends

## ARIMA (Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average)

- Used for time series analysis and forecastingÂ
